# Accessible Zen Theme Pack

Accessible Zen Theme Pack contains some goodies for the Accessible Zen WordPress theme.

Accessible Zen is an accessible, minimalistic, readable, and fully responsive WordPress theme by [David A. Kennedy](http://davidakennedy.com). Inspired by Leo Babauta's [Zen Habits theme](http://zenhabits.net/theme/), Accessible Zen puts the focus on your content and nothing else, plus it has plenty of WordPress goodness built right in.

You can read more about [Accessible Zen on its project page](http://davidakennedy.com/projects/accessible-zen/).

## Includes

* A child theme template for creating your own child themes based on Accessible Zen.

## Other Notes

* Each folder in this repository contains a separate project.
* More goodies will be added in the future to help you get the most out of Accessible Zen!
